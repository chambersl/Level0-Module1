1. Complete the for loop below so that it prints out the numbers 1­-10.
for( int i = 1 ;    i < 11        ;      i++       )
{ 
system.out.println (i)
}
2. Complete the for loop below so that it counts down and prints out 75 to 50.
for(      int i = 75        ;  i > 50       ;       i--      )
{ 
system.out.println (i)
}
3. Describe briefly what each part of the for loop does: 
for( a ; b ; c )
{               } 
a) sets a starting number
b) what its going to
c) whether its going up or down
