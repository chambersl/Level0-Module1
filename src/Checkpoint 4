1. Declare a string variable and initialize it to “yes”. If the string is equal to yes, print “happy” otherwise print
“sad”. Then print "Wednesday".
string happy = "yes"
if( happy.equals("yes")){
jOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,"happy")
}
else{
jOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null,"sad")



What happense if you set the string variable to "no"? 
2. Declare an int variable to hold your age and initialize its value. If you are under 20, print “It’s so great being
young”, otherwise print “Don’t you wish you were young!”
int Age = 14
if(age.equals("14")){
jOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "It's so great being young!")
}
else{
jOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, Don't you wish you were young!")


3. Make an input pop­up to ask the user which animal they like. If the user types “dog”, print “Dogs go woof”,
otherwise if they type “cat”, print “Cats go meow” ....and so on with other animals. If you do not have code for
the animal they type, print “I don’t know that animal.”
string animal = jOptionPane.showInputDialog(null, "Which animal do you prefer? Dogs, or Cats?")


if(animal.equals("dog")){
jOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Dogs go woof!")
}
if(animal.equals("cat")){
jOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null, "Cats go meow!")
}
else{ 
jOptionPane.showMessageDialog(null," I don't know that animal!")
